## Introduction

This tutorial focuses on deploying BPEL process on Apache ODE.

BPEL, business process execution language, which was written in XML. It is used to automatic process execution, and also known as WSBPEL and BPEL4WS. For more details see [BPEL-Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Execution_Language).

In this tutorial, we need these tools:
- Eclipse for JAVA EE ([Eclipse neon](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) and MyEclipse xxx has passed testing, other version maybe work or not.)
- [JDK 1.7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)
- [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org) (8.0 or 8.5)
- [Apache ODE](http://ode.apache.org/getting-ode.html)

OK, here we go.
